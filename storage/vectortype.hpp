	 * This class is used to define types that uses vectorized instruction sets

	 * instructions that operates on multiple data at ones.
	 *
	 *  \param T is the component type of the vector. `T` must be a primitive type
	 *           supported by the targeted instruction set.

	 *  \warning In order for these types to work properly, the vector_type object
	 * must be aligned properly. To avoid alignment problems, use memoryAllocate(size_t)
	 * and memoryFree(void*) in favour of malloc and free.
